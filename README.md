I'm a freelance system administrator and site reliability engineer based in Amsterdam, with more than 30 years of experience keeping IT reliable and maintainable.

I work with small and medium-sized organizations on system administration, device and identity management, and on-premise and cloud infrastructure, ensuring their IT stays stable as the organization grows.

My focus is on Apple and Linux-based platforms, primarily macOS, iOS, and Ubuntu.

## Focus Areas

- Apple-platform fleet management (macOS, iOS)
- Linux systems and infrastructure (Ubuntu)
- Device and identity management
- Reliability, observability, and lifecycle management
- On-premise and cloud environments

Most professional work is performed in private repositories or client infrastructure and is therefore not visible here.

## Software Development

Alongside my system administration and infrastructure work, I design and build Apple-platform software using Swift and SwiftUI, ranging from end-user applications to reusable libraries.
